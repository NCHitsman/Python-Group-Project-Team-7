# Robinhoop

Access the app [here](herokulinkhere).

Robinhoop is a simulated clone of the Robinhood Stock Trading appfocused on Basketball. With Robinhoop, users can invest in their favorite basketball teams (or the ones that are actually winning games :smirk:). Robinhoop users can buy, sell, and keep tabs on NBA basketball teams to see which ones they want to buy or sell their stock in.

Robinhoop is a simulated basketball stock market, not an actual stock market. No real currency is won, lost, or exchanged by using this app. It's mostly just for fun.
